## Short description

A simple memory card application game, getting the user to try to pick a new card every time in order to improve their score! I made it themed after the popular show Breaking Bad.

## Motivation

I used this project to practice further to use hooks and lifecycle methods as well as state. This was also a great opportunity to practice CSS grid and its functionalities, making it resize the grid depending on your screen size.
